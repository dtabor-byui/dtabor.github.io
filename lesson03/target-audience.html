            The target audience for this website will be primarily local users of varying age and economic background.
            The primary user will be interested in not only weather but local events and important weather related
            information. Each user may be motivated by different outdoor activities but the primary target will also be
            interested in the community and the local events that could pertain to him/her.

        <h3><u>Personas:</u></h3>
        <br>
        <div id="persona">
            <u>1. Betty Henderson</u>
            <p>Betty is retired and she is known for her home grown produce and her garden is the envy of the entire
                county. She uses the site to to monitor the rain fall and moisture that is anticipated so her dear
                plants receive exactly what they need to be their very best. </p>
            <u>2. Bob Anderson</u>
            <p>Bob is a welder and he works long hours getting his job done. He doesn't like to take time off for
                fishing unless he know what the weather is going to be like. Bob uses the site to make sure the time he
                spends is going to be a great day on the river. He watches the barometer and the lunar cycle and uses
                his knowledge of insects, hatches and the temperature to ensure he has the best day fishing, every day
                he takes off. </p>
            <u>3. Brett Smith</u>
            <p> Brett is a High School Teacher that loves the outdoors and has much of the summer to himself. He will
                often spend weeks in the mountains fishing and hiking. He uses the site to make long term preparations
                and to track patterns on particular mountain ranges. This information helps him to be prepared for early
                or late snows and for upcoming weather. </p>
        </div>


        <h3><u>Scenarios:</u></h3>

        <div id="senario">
            <u>1. Farm Scenario</u>
            <p>It is hay harvest season and a farmer is about to do his first hay cutting. Once that hay is on the
                ground it has to be dried and baled before it gets rained on or the value goes way down the site would
                be helpful in this scenario to assist in knowing when to cut and when to wait. </p>
            <u>2. Sports Scenario</u>
            <p>Often, events are planned around the weather, a softball tournament, outdoor tennis matches, and golf
                tournaments. This site would be useful to assist an individual planning such an event to avoid inclement
                weather with the best information available. </p>
            <u>3. Outdoors Man Scenario</u>
            <p>Being an outdoors man comes with inclement weather, but being prepared for the weather you are going to
                experience allows hikers to only carry essential gear. I can help individuals avoid treacherous weather,
                and it can be helpful in knowing when to postpone an outing due to weather concerns. </p>
            <u>4. Casual Outdoors Person Scenario</u>
            <p>This is the individual that is needing to have an event outdoors and needs to know what to expect.
                Wedding and reunions, and gatherings of all sorts wound use this site as a resource to plan or cancel
                events to be sure their guests were not exposed to dangerous or inclement weather unnecessarily. </p>
            <u>5. Member of the Community Scenario </u>
            <p>This is the individual that would be interested in only the community portion of the site. They would be
                interested in events and the happenings in their own (and surrounding) communities. This may be a young
                man trying to find an event to take a date. Perhaps, a local group looking for a place to set up a
                booth, or a scout troop planning a fund raiser. </p>
