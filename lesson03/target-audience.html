        <p>
            The target audience for this website will be primarily local users of varying age and economic background.
            The primary user will be interested in not only weather but local events and important weather-related
            information. Each user may be motivated by different outdoor activities but the primary target will also be
            interested in the community and the local events that could pertain to him/her.
        </p>

            <h3>Personas/ Senarios:</h3>
        </u><br>
        <div id="persona">
            <u>1. Local fisherman</u>
            <p>When it rains up country the river rises, and the fishing is terrible. This individual would use the site
                to optimize their time on the river to the most likely time for success. Comparing the lunar cycles and
                the rain in the mountains and current water levels this user would be able to maximize the potential of
                their day on the river. </p>
            <u>2. Local Produce Grower</u>
            <p>In this environment with such a short growing season every growing day could need to be monitored to
                maximize growing times. A local grower (whether they be a commercial or private) will benefit from the
                basic information provided. A freezes could be foretold in advance and measures could be taken to
                protect early plants from a late frost. On the contrary the first frost in the fall is critical in time
                harvest and maximizing yield</p>
            <u>3. Outdoors Enthusiast</u>
            <p>This category covers a broad range of people, from the mountain biker, to the cross-country skier.
                Little league event planners and coaches of every imaginable event. The down hill skier and the rock
                climber would all be interested in the incoming weather, and events that they could participate in.
                Camping could be planned on fair weather weekends and dangerous mountain storms could be avoided. </p>
            <u>4. The Casual Outdoors Person</u>
            <p> This category would be a person that would need to know the weather for an event or a certain time
                period. Perhaps a wedding or a family reunion. Perhaps, a scoutmaster that is trying to plan a day of
                kite flying or bike riding. Maybe a young man that is trying to come up with a local event that would be
                fun for a date, or a young lady that is trying to decide if she wants to even go on a date to that
                event. </p>
