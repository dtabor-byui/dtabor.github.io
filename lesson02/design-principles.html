            <p>Use of Whitespace</p>
            <img src="images/Dell.jpg" alt="A screen shot Of Dell's website">
            <p>Dell does a great job of highlighting the product that they are trying to sell by sorrounding it with
                white space. It makes the design seem more elegant and clean while drawing the users eye to the product.

            <p>An example of Fitts' Law</p>
            <img src="images/Boeing.jpg" alt="A screen shot Of Boeing's website">
            <p>Here we see an example of Fitts' law. Fitts suggest that the larger an object is the easiter it is for
                the human to move and then connect with that item. Boeing makes each link large so that the user can
                connect with each item easily.</p>

            <p>An example of Hick's law</p>
            <img src="images/BSH.jpg" alt="A screen shot Of Berkshire Hathaway's website">
            <p>BHCH does a great job of limiting our choices here, and that is an example of Hick's law. Hicks suggest
                that the more choices wh have the more confused humans become. By simplfying the choices it allows the
                user to make simple choices they feel good about.</p>
